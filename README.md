# SRI Yices 2

SRI Yices 2 is a solver for [Satisfiability Modulo
Theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories)
(SMT) problems. Yices 2 can process input written in the SMT-LIB language, or in Yices' own specification language.
We also provide a [C API](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2/blob/master/src/include/yices.h) 
and bindings for [Java](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2_java_bindings), [Python](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2_python_bindings), [Go](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2_go_bindings), and [OCaml](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2_ocaml_bindings).

This repository includes the source of Yices 2, documentation, tests,
and examples.

Yices 2 is developed by Bruno Dutertre, Dejan Jovanovic, StÃ©phane Graham-Lengrand, and Ian A. Mason
at the Computer Science Laboratory, SRI International. To contact us,
or to get more information about Yices, please visit our
[website](https://yices.csl.sri.com).

## Simple Examples

Here are a few typical small examples that illustrate 
the use of Yices using the [SMT2 language](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml).

#### Linear Real Arithmetic

```smt2
;; QF_LRA = Quantifier-Free Linear Real Arithmetic
(set-logic QF_LRA)
;; Declare variables x, y
(declare-fun x () Real)
(declare-fun y () Real)
;; Find solution to (x + y > 0), ((x < 0) || (y < 0))
(assert (> (+ x y) 0))
(assert (or (< x 0) (< y 0)))
;; Run a satisfiability check
(check-sat)
;; Print the model
(get-model)
```

Running Yices on the above problem gives a solution
```
> yices-smt2 lra.smt2
sat
((define-fun x () Real 2.0)
 (define-fun y () Real (- 1.0)))
```

#### Bit-Vectors

```smt2
;; QF_BV = Quantifier-Free Bit-Vectors
(set-logic QF_BV)
;; Declare variables
(declare-fun x () (_ BitVec 32))
(declare-fun y () (_ BitVec 32))
;; Find solution to (signed) x > 0, y > 0, x + y < x
(assert (bvsgt x #x00000000))
(assert (bvsgt y #x00000000))
(assert (bvslt (bvadd x y) x))
;; Check
(check-sat)
;; Get the model
(get-model)
```

Running Yices on the above problem gives

```
> yices-smt2 bv.smt2
sat
((define-fun x () (_ BitVec 32) #b01000000000000000000000000000000)
 (define-fun y () (_ BitVec 32) #b01000000000000000000000000000000))
```

#### Non-Linear Arithmetic

```smt2
;; QF_NRA = Quantifier-Free Nonlinear Real Arithmetic
(set-logic QF_NRA)
;; Declare variables
(declare-fun x () Real)
(declare-fun y () Real)
;; Find solution to x^2 + y^2 = 1, x = 2*y, x > 0
(assert (= (+ (* x x) (* y y)) 1))
(assert (= x (* 2 y)))
(assert (> x 0))
;; Check
(check-sat)
;; Get the model
(get-model)
```

Running Yices on the above problem gives

```
sat
((define-fun x () Real 0.894427)
 (define-fun y () Real 0.447214))
```

## Parallel Yices Example

Yices can be run in parallel using a portfolio approach, which launches several instances of `yices_smt2` with different configurations and returns as soon as one instance finds a solution. This is useful for hard SMT problems where different configurations may solve the problem faster.

A Python script is provided in `utils/yices2_parallel.py` for this purpose. Example usage:

```sh
python3 utils/yices2_parallel.py --yices /path/to/yices_smt2 -n 4 --verbose path/to/problem.smt2
```

- `--yices` specifies the path to the `yices_smt2` executable (default: `yices_smt2` in the script directory)
- `-n` sets the number of parallel threads/configurations (default: 4)
- `--verbose` enables detailed output
- The last argument is the path to your SMT2 file

The script will run several Yices instances in parallel and print the result (`sat`, `unsat`, or `unknown`) as soon as one instance finishes.

For more options, run:

```sh
python3 utils/yices2_parallel.py --help
```

## Installing Prebuilt Binaries

Currently you can install Yices either using Homebrew or Apt.

#### Homebrew

Installing on Darwin using homebrew can be achieved via:
```
brew install SRI-CSL/sri-csl/yices2
```
This will install the full mcsat-enabled version of Yices, including dynamic library and header files.


#### Apt

To install Yices on Ubuntu or Debian, do the following:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sri-csl/formal-methods
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install yices2
```
This will install the executables. If you also need the Yices library and header files, replace
the last step with:
```
sudo apt-get install yices2-dev
```


## Building From Source

#### Prerequisites

To build Yices from the source, you need:

- GCC version 4.0.x or newer (or clang 3.0 or newer)
- gperf version 3.0 or newer
- the GMP library version 4.1 or newer

+ other standard tools: make (gnumake is required), sed, etc.


To build the manual, you also need:

- a latex installation
- the latexmk tool

To build the on-line documentation, you need to install the Sphinx
python package. The simplest method is:

```
sudo pip install sphinx
```

Sphinx 1.4.x or better is needed.


#### Quick Installation

Do this:

```
autoconf
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

This will install binaries and libraries in `/usr/local/`. You can
change the installation location by giving option `--prefix=...` to
the `./configure` script.

For more explanations, please check `doc/COMPILING`.

#### Support for Non-Linear Arithmetic and MC-SAT

Yices supports non-linear real and integer arithmetic using a method
known as *Model-Constructing Satisfiability* (MC-SAT), but this is not
enabled by default. The MC-SAT solver also supports other theories and
theory combination. We are currently extending it to handle bit-vector
constraints.

If you want the MC-SAT solver, follow these instructions:

1. Install SRI's library for polynomial manipulation. It's available
   on [github](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/libpoly).

2. Install the CUDD library for binary-decision diagrams. We recommend
   using the github distribution: https://github.com/ivmai/cudd.

3. After you've installed libpoly and CUDD, add option
   `--enable-mcsat` to the configure command. In details, type this in
   the toplevel Yices directory:

```
autoconf
./configure --enable-mcsat
make
sudo make install
```

3. You may need to provide `LDFLAGS/CPPFLAGS` if `./configure` fails to
  find the libpoly or CUDD libraries. Other options may be useful too.  Try
  `./configure --help` to see what's there.


#### Support for Thread Safety

The Yices library is not thread safe by default, if you need a re-entrant version:
```
autoconf
./configure --enable-thread-safety
make
sudo make install
```

If configured with `--enable-thread-safety` the Yices library will be thread
safe in the following sense: as long as the creation and manipulation of
each context and each model is restricted to a single thread, there should be no races.
In particular separate threads can create their own contexts, and manipulate and check
them without impeding another thread's progress.

NOTE: `--enable-mcsat` and `--enable-thread-safety` are currently incompatible.

#### Windows Builds

We recommend compiling using Cygwin. If you want a version that works
natively on Windows (i.e., does not depend on the Cygwin DLLs), you
can compile from Cygwin using the MinGW cross-compilers. This is
explained in doc/COMPILING.


#### Documentation

To build the manual from the source, type
```
make doc
```
This will build `./doc/manual/manual.pdf`.

Other documentation is in the `./doc` directory:
